**Introduction**

In this vignette, we discuss the functionality of the R package *urbanforaging* which helps users explore and contribute to a map of edible wild plants in cities â€” with a focus on foraging in Amsterdam.

This package lets users:

- Add custom foraging locations (with species and notes)
- Fetch plant occurrence data from GBIF

This vignette demonstrates how to use these functions.

---

**Loading the Package**

```{r library}
library(urbanforaging)
```

---

**1. Add a Foraging Location**

The `add_foraging_location()` function lets you log new foraging spots (for crowd-sourcing locations or saving them for personal use)

```{r add-location}
# Create an empty base dataset
df <- data.frame(
  plant = character(),
  lat = numeric(),
  lon = numeric(),
  month = character(),
  notes = character(),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Add an example observation
df <- add_foraging_location(df, "Wild Garlic", 52.37, 4.89, "March", "Under the bridge")

df
```

---

**2. Query GBIF for Plant Observations**

Use `get_gbif_occurrences_by_month()` to fetch species occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.

```{r gbif}
wild_garlic_gbif <- get_gbif_occurrences_by_month("Allium ursinum", c("March", "April"), limit = 10)
head(wild_garlic_gbif)
```

It returns only observations with valid coordinates and dates, filtered by the specified months and limited to occurrences in the Netherlands.

---

**3. Map Results with Leaflet**

Visualize GBIF results using the `leaflet` package:

```{r map, eval = nrow(wild_garlic_gbif) > 0}
leaflet::leaflet(wild_garlic_gbif) |>
  leaflet::addTiles() |>
  leaflet::addMarkers(
    lng = ~decimalLongitude,
    lat = ~decimalLatitude,
    popup = ~scientificName
  )
```

This simple map shows where species have been observed in the city.

---

**Package Dependencies**

`urbanforaging` uses the following packages internally:

- `dplyr` for data manipulation
- `rgbif` for querying GBIF
- `leaflet` for maps

Be sure these are installed when using or deploying your package.

---

**Conclusion**

The `urbanforaging` package makes it easier than ever to gather and visualize wild edible plant data in urban settings.

Happy foraging ðŸŒ¿
