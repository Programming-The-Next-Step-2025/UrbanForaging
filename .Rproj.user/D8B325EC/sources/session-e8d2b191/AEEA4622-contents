# User Guide

## Tab 1 – Community Spots

### Scenario 1: You found an edible plant (e.g., elderflower) at a foraging spot and want to add it to the map

1. Navigate to **Community Spots** tab.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.cap="Navigate to the Community Spots tab"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/community_tab.png")
```

2. Look up the plant by typing its name and selecting it. Common and Latin names are shown.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.cap="Plant selection dropdown with images"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/plant_select.png")
```

3. Select the season/month. Optionally, add notes and a photo.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.cap="Add notes and optional photo"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/add_notes_photo.png")
```

4. Click **Add map centre**.  
5. The spot is now added. Clicking the marker reveals your photo, description, and plant info (with Wikipedia link).

### Scenario 2: Browse community entries by month

Select a season under "Show months" to filter existing foraging entries.  
You'll see other users' contributions for that month near your location.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.cap="Filter spots by month"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/filter_by_month.png")
```

## Tab 2 – GBIF Lookup

### Scenario: There are no community entries for your plant of interest?

You can still explore seasonal data via GBIF:

1. Select the plant by typing its name.  
2. Choose one or more months to filter by season.  
3. Set a max record limit (default = 500).  
4. View observations from GBIF on the map.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.cap="GBIF search and results"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/gbif_lookup.png")
```

## Tab 3 – Plant Catalogue

### Scenario: You want to learn more about a specific plant or explore out of curiosity

Use the scrollable catalogue to browse all included plants.  
Each entry includes name, image, description, and source links.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.cap="Plant catalogue overview"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/plant_catalogue.png")
```
